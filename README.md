# SECODA
Anomaly detection with SECODA for the R environment. SECODA is a general-purpose unsupervised non-parametric anomaly detection algorithm for datasets containing numerical and/or categorical attributes.

## Version
SECODA version 0.5.4 - 20200228

## A. FILES
This zip-file includes several types of files:
* SECODA implementations for R (see below)
* Example datasets and code (run the code in "Examples for R.txt")
* Publications, Help/Description files and Version information

## B. SECODA SOFTWARE
This zip-file contains several implementations of SECODA:
1. The regular SECODA as a code file that can be executed by R
1. The regular SECODA as an R package that can be installed in the R environment
1. The SECODA base R version as a code file, which runs more slowly than the regular implementation (but does not need data.table). The results are identical to the regular version. Note, however, that this base R version does not offer all options.


This software should be regarded as a beta version, and as such will undoubtedly still contain bugs.
